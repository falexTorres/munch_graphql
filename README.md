This is a Phoenix app containing examples of how to use [plug_graphql](https://github.com/graphql-elixir/plug_graphql) which in turn uses the [GraphQL Elixir Core](https://github.com/graphql-elixir/graphql)

## Installation

Clone this repo and start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create your development database using `mix ecto.create`.
     NOTE: you may need to edit `config/dev.exs` to set up your database configuration
     if it is not configured for passwordless logins on localhost.
  3. Setup your DB for the Ecto example with `mix ecto.migrate` and `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`
  4. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Examples

Using [plug_graphql](https://github.com/graphql-elixir/plug_graphql) with Phoenix is very simple.

Simply mount your GraphQL endpoint like so:

1. Define your schema in `web/graphql` (see https://github.com/graphql-elixir/munch_graphql_service_phoenix/tree/master/web/graphql)
2. [Mount your endpoint](https://github.com/graphql-elixir/munch_graphql_service_phoenix/blob/master/web/router.ex#L22-L26)
